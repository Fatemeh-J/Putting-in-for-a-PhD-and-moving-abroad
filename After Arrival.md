## The very first day

Ù‹Schiphol Airport has a train station, so you can buy an anonymous Ov-chip card and use it to check in for trains. You must install the NS program on your phone to know about the routes. This application can display train schedules. You can take a taxi or bus to your final destination once you arrive in Groningen at the hooftstation (Main station). The 9292 program is useful for tracking bus schedules. 
#### Keep in mind that you must check in and out of buses and trains:)

You can purchase a prepaid sim card within the first week (for 3 days, or 7 days). Prepaid sim cards are available at the following locations:
Albert Hein branches, Vodaphone stores(which is a provider), Primera.

Once, you open a Dutch bank account, you can buy a subscription from different providers (including Simpel, Lebara, Tele2, ...).

Once, you have a Dutch bank account you can request for a personal Ov-chip card (by this card you can benefit from discounts).

### Transport to and within Groningen

There is free WiFi at the Schiphol airport, cafes, trains, and buses.

## The first week
The most important thing is your appointment with Gemente (municipality). There you can get a BSN number which is usefull for bank account opening and tax authorities.

- Phone sim card: https://dutchreview.com/expat/mobile-phones-netherlands/

- Bank account: [This site](https://www.rug.nl/education/bachelor/international-students/financial-matters/opening-dutch-bank-account?tcid=verint_10_14002_14009) may be useful in providing an overview of Dutch banks. "Geldmaat" is the Dutch word for ATM. You must find a geldmaat if you want to deposit cash, however, all the geldmaats doesn't take notes. I know two of them: one in the Paddepoel, and the other is in the city center, near ABNAmro bank.

- DigiD: It is related to tax fairs, and you must apply for it after receiving your BSN number.

- Health insurance: You have different options, including AON, Menzis, and etc. After applying for a health insurance, you have to send the insurance information to [here](https://www.studentarts.nl/).

### Bicycle: 

There are two options for bicycles:

1. Rent a bike: You can purchase a subscription from [OV-fiets](https://www.ns.nl/en/door-to-door/ov-fiets), [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.nl/), [Go](https://nl.go-sharing.com/blog/go-explore-noord-nederland/)(as far as I know it is for electric bikes). As an instance, Swapfiets subscription is around 23Euros each month.


2. Buy a bicycle: It could be either new or second-hand.

- Here is the option if you would like to purchase from an Iranian guy: [Gro Fietsen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8bQVdTKod2d8Bqcd8)

- There are also some other second-hand bicycle stores which could be found in google maps. 

- You can also buy bicycle from Facebook Marketplace (be aware to get a purchase receipt)

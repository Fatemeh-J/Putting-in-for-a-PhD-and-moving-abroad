## The very first day

Ù‹Schiphol Airport has a train station, so you can buy an anonymous Ov-chip card and use it to check in for trains. You must install the NS program on your phone to know about the routes. This application can display train schedules. You can take a taxi or bus to your final destination once you arrive in Groningen at the hooftstation (Main station). The 9292 program is useful for tracking bus schedules.

You can purchase a prepaid sim card within the first week (for 3 days, or 7 days). Prepaid sim cards are available at the following locations:
Albert Hein branches, Vodaphone stores(which is a provider), Primera.

Once, you open a Dutch bank account, you can buy a subscription from different providers (including Simpel, Lebara, Tele2, ...).

Once, you have a Dutch bank account you can request for a personal Ov-chip card (by this card you can benefit from discounts).
